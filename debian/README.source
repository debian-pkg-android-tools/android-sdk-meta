licenses/apache-2.0
===================

The filename must be identical to the "id" attribute of the "license" nodes in
"package.xml" in all Android SDK packages, including this package and
"android-sdk-platform-*".

The content is the SHA1 hash of the text content of the "license" nodes, at
least for now it's SHA1 hash. See getLicenseHash() in [1].

This file is mandatory for telling the build system that the user has accepted
the licenses, otherwise error.
